  /* There are 3 types to access the methods inside a class during inheritance - Public, Private & Protected
  *  Public - can be accessed in Subclass & any instances of the new baseclass/super class
  *  Private - can be accessed only inside the scope of the base class
  *  Protected - can be accessed on either base class or sub class but not on the new instantiations
  *  Has examples for overriding and constructors
  *  Use Super to access/use methods in base class
  *  Prevent Override : Use Final keyword, Use Final to prevent class being Inherited, Seal the class - can be inherited only in this file */
